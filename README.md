# Smart Queuing System
Project 2 of the **IntelÂ® Edge AI for IoT Developers** Nanodegree Program.

## The project
The aim of the project is to develop a _smart queuing system_ and choose the appropriate _hardware_ for three different scenarios:

- [Retail](scenarios/retail/RETAIL.md)
- [Manufacturing](scenarios/manufacturing/MANUFACTURING.md)
- [Transportation](scenarios/transportation/TRANSPORTATION.md)

To meet the customer requirements and constraints for each scenario, the system is tested on CPU, Integrated GPU, VPU and FPGA. 

### Project steps
The project has been developed following the steps below.
#### Choose best hardware
A best hardware choice has initially been determined based on the requirements and needs for each [scenarios](scenarios/SCENARIOS.md). 

The initial choice is documented in the [hardware choice](scenarios/hardware_choice.docx) document. 

#### Build application and test
TODO: Build out your application and job submission code

#### Compare performance
TODO: 
- Test performance on the DevCloud using multiple hardware types
- Compare the performance to see which hardware performed best

#### Revise hardware choice
TODO: Revise proposal based on the test results
