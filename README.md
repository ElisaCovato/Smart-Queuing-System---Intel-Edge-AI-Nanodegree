# Smart Queuing System
Project 2 of the **IntelÂ® Edge AI for IoT Developers** Nanodegree Program.

## The project
The aim of the project is to develop a _smart queuing system_ and choose the appropriate _hardware_ for three different scenarios:

- [Retail](scenarios/retail/RETAIL.md)
- [Manufacturing](scenarios/manufacturing/MANUFACTURING.md)
- [Transportation](scenarios/trasnportation/TRANSPORTATION.md)

To meet the customer requirements and constraints for each scenario, the system is tested on CPU, Integrated GPU, VPU and FPGA. 

### Project steps
- Propose a possible hardware solution
- Build out your application and test its performance on the DevCloud using multiple hardware types
- Compare the performance to see which hardware performed best
- Revise your proposal based on the test results
